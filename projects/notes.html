	<p>
		This is a portfolio of past and current projects for Joshua Willsey. 
		Updated regularly as projects progress, you can follow along with me and see new things as they come up! 
		I'm always looking for more people to work on things with me, so if you have an idea or want to work on one of mine, please email me! Contact info is on the "resume" page.
		Lots more to come, so stay tuned.
