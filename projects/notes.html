		<br>Challenges: The first page caused me trouble, believe it or not. 
		<br>
		<br>It took me about three and a half hours (of on and off work) to figure out how to center something vertically and horizontally, no matter how wide the window.
		<br>Once I understood how to do that, though, the rest kind of fell into place relatively quickly...Until I got to positioning the initial project view. The text worked just fine, but once I added images, positioning got off by a lot. It took some doing to move it back on track.
		<br>
		<br>Above and Beyond: Still working on that. 
		<br>
		<br>Improvements: Make portfolio itself into a game: a game that is easily winnable (for those who just want my information quickly), but entertaining if you choose to play for the sake of the game instead of the information.
