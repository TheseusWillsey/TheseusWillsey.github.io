	<h3>Title In Progress</h3>
	<br>
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<br>
	<p>This is a card-based board game for 2, expandable to multiple people. Players try to advance to the end of the track by competing with cards.</p>

	<br>
	<h4>Gameplay</h4>
	<p>The game is played in rounds. Each player places two roles down, one in the Primary position and one in the Secondary.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The two players compare the power of their Primaries, backed by the abilities of the Secondaries, and the resulting difference in power advances their piece along the track.</p>

	<h4>Future Development</h4>
	<br>
	<p>This game can be expanded to include multiple people trying to push their pieces along the track, maybe including a hidden role mechanic. Definitely more players is a development goal.</p>
