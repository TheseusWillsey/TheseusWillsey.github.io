	<p>A project for Innovation and Invention (this is actually a class, which I love) worked on with two other members. 
	My involvement is centered around the user experience, involving the development of an algorithm to recommend nearby events to people 
	looking to be entertained, an introductory quiz to take in initial information, and the demand currently on the market for this kind of service.</p>
